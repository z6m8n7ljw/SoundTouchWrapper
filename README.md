A simple C wrapper for C++ source codes of SoundTouch library. This project is forked from [IoLanguage/SoundTouch](https://github.com/IoLanguage/SoundTouch) and [deepin-community/soundtouch](https://github.com/deepin-community/soundtouch).

***Note***
This wrapper is only for pitch adjustment. If you need other adjustments, such as tempo and rate, please add them yourself.
